## GitHub

### Public project

**Free** on GitHub but be aware that the project will be **visible** to everyone.

---

### Private project

With a **free** plan, you can set your project as private, up to 4 collaborators.

The **pro** plan ($7/month) allows you to have more than 4 collaborators on an unlimited number of private repositories

Private projects are visible only to **repo collaborators**.

---

### Alternatives

- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)

You can use multiple cloud hosting for your git repositories!

---

### GitHub Organization

Example: [github.com/lewagon](https://github.com/lewagon)

* [GitHub - User and organization differences](https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts)
* [GitHub - Converting a user into an organization](https://help.github.com/articles/converting-a-user-into-an-organization)

## Create a repo

### Hacker's version

```bash
cd ~/code/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
mkdir YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
```

You can then create your Github repo with:

```bash
hub create
```

Which creates the repo on Github and adds the `origin` remote to your local repo.

---

### Alternative version

</figure>

---

Then you need to add a remote:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.git
git push origin master
```

---

## Adding collaborators

---

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_click_on_settings.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tAVCxqBZFTC4583TZW1pgtMK" />
</figure>

---

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_add_collaborator.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/4ZCfYLwQL5r2yVY7faToNq7p" />
</figure>

---

You gave them **push** access to the repository.

(and [other](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/#collaborator-access-on-a-repository-owned-by-a-user-account) rights)

---

Collaborators will have to accept your invitation.

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_accept_invitation.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/N6robKZ4ajbhC1Z1qQxYJNQU" />
</figure>

---

Now, collaborators can **clone** the project on their own computer:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OWNER_GITHUB_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git
cd PROJECT_NAME
```

Clone with **`SSH`**, **not** HTTPS.

<figure style="width: 100%">

## Working as a team

### Think of features (user stories)

```text
As a <ROLE>
I can <ACTION>
So that <VALUE>
```
---

### Problems

- Overlap (we both need to change `index.js`)
- Dependency (I need your feature done to start mine)

---

### Solutions

- Technical (`git` branching)
- Human (communication)

---

### Git Branching

When cloning a repository, you're by default on a branch, `master`.

One rule: one feature == one branch.

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="git-branching.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fdqL5r5bTYFvaZ7cykAVRKtd" />
</figure>

---

### Listing local branches

```bash
git branch
```

---

### Working on a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
git branch
```

---
For example:
```bash
git checkout -b custom-navbar
git branch
```

We've created a new local branch called **custom-navbar**.

Any new commit will only be applied to this branch.

---

### Pushing a branch to GitHub

```bash
git branch -a
git push origin custom-navbar
git branch -a
```

---

### Finishing a feature

Using branches, we work on different parts of a project at the same time.

When a feature is finished, we'd like to **merge** commits back in `master`.

**How?**

---

## GitHub Pull Requests

### Usage

- Get feedback on code written in a given branch (code review)
- Merge the branch back into master

---

### A Pull Request is a conversation

Example: [rails/rails#30067](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/30067).

---

### Creating a Pull Request (1)

As soon as you push a new branch, a pull request button appears on your GitHub repository page.

Just click on this button, review the diff and add clear title and description.

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="compare-and-pull-request-button-easy-way.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/qucuNtdofBKotkHz2cg3gX6u" />
</figure>

---

### Creating a Pull Request (2)

- Take some time to write a proper **title** and **description**
- Explain what you did on the branch (package added, code tricks, etc...)
- Ease the reviewer's job
- You can poke people with `@...`, like `@ssaunier` or `@papillard` to get their feedback

---

### Reviewing a Pull Request

- Look at the diff, comment on errors (indentation, style, useless code, etc.)
- Comment **inline** or at the pull request level
- When done:
  - If code is fine, click on "Merge Pull Request" then "Delete Branch"
  - If not, add a general comment "Review done"

---

### Using Github Review feature (1)

Add a comment to a specific line

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_review_feature_1.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/24XgYXFZ7VprAU282H5qQBJo" />
</figure>

---

### Using Github Review feature (2)

Submit all your comments and add a summary

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_review_feature_2.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/DorUQQ4BnkprJqxzg8A3yYeG" />

  <img alt="github_pull_request.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/7mUDM5d92oEqwaCkpJr8wMCr" />
</figure>

---

## Looping over

---

### Getting `master` up to date

When a Pull Request is **merged**, a new commit is created on `master`.

You need to fetch it on your **local** repository.

---

### Be **very** careful

First, you need a **CLEAN** git status.

```bash
git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
# nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

---

### Get the latest `master`

```bash
# Remember! You must have a **clean** git status
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

---

### Merging `master` in your branches

In case you need something in `master` back into your current branch

```bash
# 1/ Commit your branch
(my-feature) git add .
(my-feature) git commit -m 'XXXX'
(my-feature) git status # MAKE SURE STATUS IS CLEAN

# 2/ Check out master and pull the latest version
(my-feature) git checkout master
(master)     git pull origin master

# 3/ Check out your branch again and merge
(master)     git checkout my-feature
(my-feature) git merge master
```

---

### 2 rules

- **Never** commit directly to `master`. Use feature branches.
- **Always** make sure `git status` is **clean** before `pull`, `checkout` or `merge`.

---

### In case of conflict (1)

Sometimes a Pull Request won't be mergeable.

Why? `master` changed between the time you created the branch and now.

```bash
git status # ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure it's clean before proceeding
git checkout master
git pull origin master          # pull the latest changes
git checkout unmergeable-branch # switch back to your branch
git merge master                # merge the new changes from master into your branch

# üò± Conflicts will appear. It's normal!
# üëå Open sublime and solve conflicts (locate them with cmd + shift + f `<<<<<`)
# When solved, we need to finish the merge

git add .                           # add the files in conflict
git commit ---no-edit                # commit using the default commit message
git push origin unmergeable-branch  # push our branch again
```

---

### In case of conflict (2)

You can also solve conflicts on Github. Click on `Resolve conflicts`.

### Debugging Git

* If you follow the few rules mentioned before, you'll be fine! ;)
* If something happened check out [Oh Shit Git](https://ohshitgit.com/)

---

Keep only the code you want to keep, and remove the special characters that highlighted the conflict

<figure style="width: 100%">
  <img alt="github_resolve_conflict_2.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/XMdcKvNWVpBuYyrFEdMWJTFL" />

  <img alt="github_resolve_conflict_3.png" src="https://wagon-rc3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/BEmSz3FPMSDXwgGjLS2TiMjL" />
</figure>

When it's done, click on `Mark as resolved` and `Commit merge`.
