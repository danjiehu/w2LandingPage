## Goal:

You'll release a project with two products by end of two weeks week! Then demo on Sunday of your last day.

This time, project can be anything that was voted on by your team. Use APIs and what you've already built to save you time!

Keep in mind special business licenses are required for WeChat app to be fully released.

Once released, real users can sign on and use your app! Congratulations on your first tech product release. Your demo day can be a launch party as well - get real users before you leave the camp!


## Day 1 (Tue):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: index page of cards on MP for approval

2. Landing page for web (using mobile landing from challenge of week 1)

3. Write for this week's work

- User stories
- Mockups (use Figma from product design sprint)
- API endpoints (and tables)

The focus is on having a simple but complete and polished MP to show at the end of **this** week!

Pro Tip: This iterative product building is very helpful in a real world business. You have to deliver what people want constantly and well, for your developers, partners, and investors to continue to invest and work with you.

Also it takes feedback and adjustments at the end of the week, so you **don't have to** make all the decisions right away and set it in stone! Just set a goal you can all deliver by end of week and start developing the right way.


### Splitting responsibilities by role:

- One person (Web Developer) in charge of landing page

- One person (Backend) in charge of Backend as a Service (Baas)

- One person (Frontend) in charge of Mini Program (MP)

- One person (PM) creating repository, register domain, prepare for WeChat submission

All throughout the week, you can switch up roles and work on all parts of web and MP stack. But one person is always **in charge** and **accountable** for each part.

## Day 2 (Thu):

1. ** Submit** to Wechat: usually the index and ecommerce pages

2. Practice demo presentation with your own team



## Day 3 (Sat):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: usually the index, ecommerce, and membership center
2. Practice demo at end of day

This time we'll do a full mock rehearsal on stage with all the equipment for the final demo. It'll be done with whatever is released so far!


## Day 4 (Tue):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: additional features on your app

2. Write for rest of project

- User stories
- Mockups (use Figma from product design sprint)
- API endpoints (and tables)

Now is where good development planning pays off. The core features should be in your simple released app last week. This week you can add additional features and any bells and whistles (perhaps blog like posts).

Because your **must-haves** are done last week, you have time now to experiment and try new things. So go nuts! Add these **good-to-haves** and if the don't work, you can always try something else to build upon your foundation.

Take this trial-and-error mentality with you for rest of your career. Any business or tech decision has risks and need to be adjusted. It's a natural part of discovering the unknown and doing new things!

However if you develop fast and plan smart, you can actually help this  process by getting data and feedback from real people. Don't sit on an idea and spent tons of development before releasing! Validate sooner, and validate often!


## Day 5 (Thu):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: additional features on your app

2. Practice final demo presentation with your own team



## Day 6 (Sat):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: additional features on your app

2. Practice final demo presentation with your own team

End of day there is code freeze (you don't want your demo tomorrow to break because of last minute changes!).


## Demo Day (Sunday):

- 5 minutes

- story telling format

  - one - two speakers, one operator
  - speakers show mini app user journey (customer)
  - operator assists with above, and also shows landing page or user dashboard (manager / business journey)

Note:
- You can **must** present your MP that is official release on WeChat (no dev mode)
- If you have a real product, you should have an ICP to use it for your BaaS to make it permanent.

- Landing page are linked to your own domain (but can be hosted on github pages).

Congratulations on making it! You should very proud of what you're able to accomplish in these 9 weeks, and we welcome you to keep activity in our alumni and tech communities - continue learning and growing your tech careers.
