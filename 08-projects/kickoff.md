## Objectives

You'll release a project with two products by the end of three weeks!

This time, the project can be anything that was voted on by your team. Use APIs and what you've already built with us to save you time! Then demo it on Sunday of your last week.

Keep in mind:
- Special business licenses are required for a WeChat app to be fully released
- Once released, real users can sign on and use your app! 

Congratulations on your first tech product release. Your demo day can be a launch party as well - get real users before you leave the camp.

## Tips for Week 1

- The focus is on having a simple but complete and polished MP to show at the end of Week 1!
- Pro Tip: This iterative product building is very helpful in a real-world business. You have to deliver what people want constantly and well, for your developers, partners, and investors to continue to invest and work with you.
- Also, it takes feedback and adjustments at the end of the week, so you **don't have to** make all the decisions right away and set it in stone! Just set a goal you can all deliver by the end of the week and start developing it right away.

### Splitting responsibilities by role:

- One person (Web Developer) in charge of landing page
- One person (Backend) in charge of Backend as a Service (Baas)
- One person (Frontend) in charge of Mini Program (MP)
- One person (PM) time management and preparing for WeChat submission

All throughout the week, you can switch up roles and work on all parts of the MP. But one person is always **in charge** and **accountable** for each part.

## Day 1 (Tue):

Your goals for this day:
1. **Submit** to Wechat: Index page of simple cards on MP for approval
2. **Write** for this week's work

- User stories
- Mockups
- API endpoints (and tables)

## Day 2 (Thu):

Your goals:
1. **Submit** to Wechat: Usually the index and eCommerce pages
2. Practice demo presentation with your own team

## Day 3 (Sat):

Your goals:
1. **Submit** to Wechat: Usually the index, eCommerce, and membership center
2. Practice demo at end of day

This time we'll do a full **mock rehearsal** on stage with all the equipment for the final demo. It'll be done with whatever is released so far!

## Tips for Week 2

Now is where good development planning pays off. The **core features** should be in your app released last week. This week you can **add additional features** and any bells and whistles (perhaps blog-like posts).

Because your **must-haves** are done last week, you have time now to experiment and try new things. So go nuts! Add these **good-to-haves**. But if they don't work, you can always try something else to build upon your foundation.

Take this trial-and-error mentality with you for the rest of your career. Any business or tech decision has risks and needs to be adjusted. It's a natural part of discovering the unknown and doing new things!

However, if you develop fast and plan smart, you can actually help this process by getting data and feedback from real people. Don't sit on an idea and spend tons of development before releasing it! Validate sooner, and validate often!

## Day 4 (Tue):

Your goals:
1. **Submit** to Wechat: Additional features on your app
2. **Update** for rest of project

- User stories
- Mockups
- API endpoints (and tables)

## Day 5 (Thu):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: Additional features on your app
2. Practice final demo presentation with your own team

## Day 6 (Sat):

1. **Submit** to Wechat: Additional features on your app
2. Practice final demo presentation with your own team

End of the day there is **code freeze** (you don't want your demo tomorrow to break because of last-minute changes!).

## Demo Day (Sunday):

- 5 minutes per team

- Storytelling format
  - One/two speakers, one operator
  - Speakers show mini-appâ€™s user journey (customer)
  - Operator assists with above, and also shows landing page or user dashboard

Note:
- You **must** present your MP that is officially released on WeChat (no dev mode)
- If you have a real product, you should have an ICP to use it for your BaaS to make it permanent.

## Congratulations on making it ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

You should be very proud of what you're able to accomplish in this camp.
