How do you convert millions of fans into 几万 users and sell 几百万RMB?

You'll learn that this week!



## Objectives

Build a WeChat Mini Program (MP) similar to Xiaohongshu, using social and ecommerce functions. Use your *own idea* based on something you're passionate about!

When classes are not going on, you are welcome to *keep working together*, and bring your questions in with you to class or ask on group chat.



## Teams

You'll be working in your project team from this week onwards. Everyone has a role and area of responsibility. But all can **work in any part** of the app.

### Splitting responsibilities by role:

- Designer: Mockups and wxml

- Backend: Backend as a Service (BaaS)

- Frontend: Mini Program (MP)

- Project Manager(PM): User stories and deliverables (WeChat submissions)

  

## WeChat Licenses

Special business licenses are required for WeChat app approval and release:

- E-Commerce
- Social platform

If you can't get registered in time, may be able to use our license, but it'll only be valid during camp.

So we recommend you take care of that business entity registration before the start as mentioned in the first weeks!

## Day 1

Your goals *everyday*
1. **Submit** to Wechat: index of cards and show page for approval

   After approval: create cards and social functions

2. **Write**

- User stories
- Mockups
- Tables Schema

*Pro Tip: By submitting index page first, without any posting features for user generated content, you have a higher chance of getting approved by Tencent!*

## Day 2

1. **Submit** to Wechat: index and ecommerce pages
2. Practice demo presentation with teacher

## Day 3

1. **Submit** to Wechat: index, ecommerce, and membership center
2. Demo products at end of day (7pm)

## Demos

- 5 minutes per team
- story-telling format

  - one or two speakers, one computer operator
  - speakers show user journey as customers
  - operator assists with above, and also shows any web interfaces like landing page & admin dashboards 

You should present your MP as **official release** on WeChat.

Tip: *Don't reinvent the wheel* -  use what's already built! You've actually been building all parts of this app since the first week. Now it's time to **put it all together** and see how **fast and efficient** your **teamwork** can be!

Good luck and enjoy this exciting process.
