# Xiaohongshu challenge

## Objectives

A Landing Page hosted on your own domain

WeChat Mini Program (MP) similar to Xiaohongshu, using social and ecommerce functions

When classes are not going on, you are welcome to work together, and bring your questions in with you to class or ask on group chat.

## WeChat Licenses

Special business licenses are required for WeChat app approval and release:

- Ecommerce
- Social platform

We can try to let you create an app under our license, but it's temporary of course.

So we recommend you take care of that business entity registration before the start as mentioned in the first weeks!

## Day 1

Your goals:
1. **Submit** to Wechat: index page of cards on MP for approval
2. **Create** a Landing page for web (using mobile landing from challenge of week 1)
3. **Write**

- User stories
- Mockups
- API endpoints (and tables)

*Pro Tip: By submitting index page first, without any posting features for user generated content, you have a higher chance of getting approved by Tencent!*

### Splitting responsibilities by role:

- One person (Web Developer) in charge of landing page

- One person (Backend) in charge of Backend as a Service (Baas)

- One person (Frontend) in charge of Mini Program (MP)

- One person (PM) creating repository, register domain, prepare for WeChat submission

## Day 2

1. **Submit** to Wechat: index and ecommerce pages
2. Practice demo presentation with teacher

## Day 3

1. **Submit** to Wechat: index, ecommerce, and membership center
2. Demo at end of day

## Demos

- 5 minutes per team
- story telling format

  - one/two speakers, one operator
  - speakers show mini app user journey (customer)
  - operator assists with above, and also shows landing page or user dashboard (manager / business journey)

**Notes**
- You can present your MP without official release on WeChat (but on trial mode, not dev)
- However if you have an ICP, you can use it for your BaaS to make it permanent (optional).
- Landing pages are linked to your own domain (but can be hosted on github pages).
- Remember the API philosophy: don't reinvent the wheel - but use what's already built! You've actually been building all parts of this app since the first week. Now it's time to put it all together and see how fast and efficient your teamwork can be!

Good luck and enjoy this exciting process.
