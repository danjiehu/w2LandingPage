## Working as a team

### Collaboration

**Every day planning is key!** Build from the inside out: 
First **must-have** core stories and then **good-to-have** additions.

A good plan is flexible, letting stories change without depending on any one story for the product to be complete (except the few core stories that is to be done before others).

Everybody talks and everyone takes ownership, the manager just makes sure all responsibilities are covered and assigned, to be done within time available.

**Daily sprints: key to velocity is planning, communication, and working across roles**

Start the day with a **standup** that focus on **one key deliverable** for the day. Pick a must-have core story if available. Everyone works together to make sure it's delivered and deployed by end of day.

Example:

```
- PM: goal for today is letting users see cards
- Design: I'll start designing this page with hard-coded fake data.
- Frontend: Wait, let's all decide on the data from a mockup and so I can receive and send data for the page. We'll start right after standup and take just 10 minutes. 
- Backend: Ok my goal today is to setup the BaaS table that provides this data. 
- Frontend: Perfect - I'll hard-code this data from our mockup as if it's coming from the backend to serve the page - which Design will give me later. This way no one is blocked or waiting for anyone else today - and if we all meet our goal precisely, all pieces will come together.
- PM: I will follow up with you guys to make sure you have the mockup in 10 minutes, then review the design, the frontend, and backend tables as they're being worked on. I'll make sure we're all on the right track today and everyone has work to do. This way we won't get surprises at the end of the day. We'll deploy exactly what we planned on-time then we can all go home. 
- PM: Standup is done, go team!
```



### Mockups

Try a [Online Tool](https://wireframe.cc/AWGmuu) or just on paper! There's also [Modao](https://modao.cc/) and [Basalmiq](https://balsamiq.com).

Think napkin drawings. Do a page in just a few minutes! Not for designing (for Figma and other tools!)  just getting an idea down.



Need inspiration? Research [examples](https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/)!



### Schema

### User stories

```
As a <ROLE>
I can <ACTION>
So that <VALUE>
```

e.g.

```
As a customer
I can see all the cards
So that I can learn and interact with them
```



Stories go from left to right (TODO > In Progress > Done) as they're being completed.

Note that *development stories* the tasks people mentioned in the stand up! They can be added as well and tracked.



You can now work **anywhere**, **anytime**, with people who all **know what to do** and **where to find info**. 

This is the modern method of collaboration that's a vital part of the digital economy!

## Happy Collaborating!
