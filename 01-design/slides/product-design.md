## Product Design Sprint
Let's prototype your app

---

## Outline
1. Product pitch, persona, user journey 
2. User flow
3. Wireframe & Prototype
4. Mockup & Visual Identity

---

## 1. Product Pitch
A framework to define your product

---

A Product Pitch should define:
### Target Users (type > segment) 👩‍💻👨‍💻
### Initial need 🙏
### Goal 🎯
### Competitors 🌧️
### Differentiator 💪

---

It's a product...
### **For** these users (type > segment)
### **Who need to** do this
### **And want to** achieve that
### **They choose** your product
### **Because** it allows this
### **Unlike** these competitors

---

## Let's try it!
### ![width:200](https://github.com/lewagon/china-product/raw/master/01-design/slides/product-design/airbnb.jpg)

---

It's a product...
### **For**  travelers (type) of 30 years old (segment)
### **Who need to** book a place
### **And want to**  live authentic experiences
### **They choose** Airbnb
### **Because** they can book homes from locals
### **Unlike** booking.com

---

### The need is the **action** users have to complete
- It’s the *initial* trigger.
- What makes them look for a solution.

---

### The goal is the **objective** users want to reach
- It’s the result they hope to get *in the future*.
- What makes them choose *your* product.

---

Example of *needs*

### **Airbnb** - book a place
### **Google Analytics** - analyse website traffic & behaviours
### **Trello** - manage a pipeline (product/sales)
### **Typeform** - create surveys
### **Netflix** - watch movies & series

---

Example of *goals*

### **Airbnb** - live authentic experiences
### **Google Analytics** - improve conversion rates 
### **Trello** - close more deals
### **Typeform** - generate new leads

### **Netflix** - be entertained

---

Different types of users have different needs

### *travelers* need to **book a place**
### *owners* need to **rent their home**

### ![width:200](https://github.com/lewagon/china-product/raw/master/01-design/slides/product-design/airbnb.jpg)

---

Different segments of the same type have same need but different goals

### *UX Designers* want to **improve conversion rates**
### *Marketing managers* want to **optimise their campaigns / increase traffic**

### Your differentiator = **Why users choose you?**
What better helps them achieve their goals compared to competition

### **Demo 💻** UX Spreadsheet
Let's build a Product Pitch / Persona / Core User Journey from lew.ag/ux-research

---

## 2. User Flow
Translate your user journey into a flow chart

## 3. Wireframe and Prototype
Validate usability with user tests on your prototype.

---

### Start by building a **UI Kit**
Minimal kit with *headers*, *links*, *buttons*, *inputs*, *cards*, *avatar*

### **Demo 💻** UI Kit with Figma
Let’s discover Figma basic features and build a simple UI kit

---

### Use your kit to build your **wireframe**
Set rulers to ensure content alignment
