## Guidelines

### Setup
Before you start:

- Sign up to [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co)
- Sign up to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and install the desktop app from [this page](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

<hr>

For the rest of the week, you will be working in your **project teams** to design your product!

### Thursday

1. **7:00pm - 8:30pm**: Lecture
2. **8:30pm - 10:00pm (or until done)**:  ðŸ‘‰ use your product pitch to define your **primary persona** (45 min) and ðŸ‘‰ write down your **core user journey** and translate it into a user flow with [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co) (45 min).

- For your product's persona and user journey, download our [UX Research spreadsheet](https://github.com/dounan1/china-product/blob/master/01-design/exercises/UXResearch.xlsx?raw=true) and complete the different templates. 

### Saturday

3. **9:00am - 10:00am** (60 min) ðŸ‘‰ build your UI kit and start working on your wireframe
4. **10:00am - 10:30am**: learn to integrate a visual identity to your wireframe (see video tutorial below ðŸ‘‡)
5. **10:30am - 5:00pm**: finish your prototype and start adding the visual identity. Work from the inside out, do rough outlines before adding details and media. It's more strategic to have a kickass prototype in black and white rather than a poor mockup with lots of pictures and colors but that no one understands ðŸ˜¬.
6. **5:00pm**: **pitch your product** by showcasing your prototype! ðŸŽ‰

#### Design resources

- **Fonts**: download and install `.ttf` fonts from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [getthefont](https://www.getthefont.com/)
- **Colors**: find them on [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) or use a color picker like [Colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/)

- **Icons**: download and use [Nucleo app](https://nucleoapp.com/) for utility icons

### Demo
When you are done, copy / paste your prototype URL on your product's page in Kitt. To get the prototype URL, first play your prototype and then click on the `Share  Prototype` button like below:
