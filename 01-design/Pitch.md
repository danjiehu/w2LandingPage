It's **Pitch day**, which means after today, you will have a team and a project idea for the rest of camp. 

Remember, you only have **3 minutes** to present. Some key points:

- Who is the target? Define your customer segment accurately.
- What's the pain your product tackles?
- What's the solution?

After the vote, the teams are final! So make sure you pitch your best to win your teammates over.
