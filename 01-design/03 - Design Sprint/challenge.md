# Product Design Sprint

Today we'll be desiging your own unique product idea!

Keep in mind that next Saturday, each student will pitch their product idea to the rest of the class. ðŸ“£

This is a great opportunity for you to clarify your product idea and communicate it effectively next week. ðŸ’¡

## Resources

- [User Research Google Sheet](http://lew.ag/ux-research)

- [Whimsical](http://whimsical.co/)

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Schedule

1. 9:00am - 10:00am: Create your Product Pitch

2. 10:00am - 11:00am: Create your User Persona & User Journey

3. 11:00am - 12:00pm: Draw your app's User Flow with Whimsical

4. Lunch Break!

5. 1:00pm - 3:00pm: Build your UI kit and start working on your wireframe

6. 3:00pm - 5:00pm: finish your prototype and start adding the visual identity. Work from the inside out, do rough outlines before adding details and media.

    It's more strategic to have a kickass prototype in black and white rather than a poor mockup with lots of pictures and colors but that no one understands ðŸ˜¬.

Good luck! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
