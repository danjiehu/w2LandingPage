# UX Design Challenge

Work with your buddy to create a Product Pitch and User Flow for an existing Chinese application.

## Challenge Directions

### 1. Choose a well-known Chinese application

This can be anything, think of applications that you and your buddy use on a daily basis. Some examples might be:

- é¥¿äº†ä¹ˆ

- å¤§ä¼—ç‚¹è¯„

- iTalki

### 2. Create Your Product Pitch

This will require a Google account.

1. Access Le Wagon's [UX Research Google Sheet](lew.ag/ux-research)

2. In the Goolge Sheet, under the *"File"* dropdown, choose *"Make a copy"* and save it under *"My Drive"*

3. If you're working with a buddy, "Share" your copied Google Sheet to them using their email. 

    **Note:** Make sure that your buddy has "edit" persmission for this Google Sheet

    **2nd Note:** You can change your current tab by toggling through the options on the bottom of the Google Sheet. Make sure you're making changes only to the "Exercise - XXX" tabs. 

4. You're all set! Now you can start making edits to UX Research Google Sheet.

5. Once you're done, grab an instructor or TA to check your work.

### 3. Create your User Flow

With your Product Pitch created, let's get started on building your User Flow with Whimsical.

1. Create an account on [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/)

2. Once connected, choose the *"+FlowChart"* option on the top of your Whimsical Dashboard.

3. Drag and drop elements into your Whimsical file to create your User Flow. Remember, squares are pages, arrows are actions. Keep it Simple Stupid (KISS).

### 4. Finished Early, Try This ðŸ‘‡

1. Take another look at your application, are there any other Users that your application serves?

    If so, add those User Personas to your UX Research Google Sheet

    Most applications have multiple user types, however, it's always good to start out simply with one user.

2. Note any additional User Journeys in your application.

    Popular applications generally have many user journeys throughout their product, this is great if you have a large team and ample resources...

    But as we begin building our own applications, remember to start small with one user journey, perfect it, then build out from there.

3. Translate those additional User Journeys into User Flows using Whimsical

### 5. Sharing Time ðŸ“£

Each group of buddies will share their application and walk the group through their UX Research Google Sheet and Whimsical User Flow.

**Great Job!** You've succesfully completed your first day in our Part Time Product Development Program. ðŸŽ‰

This is just the beginning. 

Properly defining your application before we start developing is critical. Using User Journeys and User Flows is a great way to communicate your idea without investing the time and energy into actually creating the application.

This means that you get feedback *fast* and *cheap*.

Tomorrow, we'll begin the next step in our journey of Design. **User Interaction**!

During this class, we'll learn about how to take our User Flow and turn them into high fidelity mockups.

See you then!
