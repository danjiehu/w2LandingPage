# Welcome & Today's Agenda

Together we will make innovative apps for China!üöÄüöÄüöÄ

- We'll be spending two weekday afternoons (Tues and Thurs, 7-10pm), and a full weekend day (Sat, 9am-6pm) together **including holidays**.
- You are invited to any camp events organized by our staff (they will introduce themselves throughout camp and mention upcoming events). These events include: 
  - Meeting companies and leaders (CEOs, who's who of the Tech scene, entrepreneurs...)
  - Informal, friendly socials with community and alumni around drinks

## Typical weekday overview

- **7:00 PM - 8:30 PM**: Evening lecture (and sometimes interleaved with exercises) in the classroom. Quite intense. Don't be late, the lecture starts on time with or without you!

- **8:30 PM - 10:00 PM  (or until done)**
  - Exercises on the learning platform with a buddy. You should take enough time with your buddy to read the exercises from top to bottom, discuss it to be sure it's properly understood, and share ideas on how to complete the exercise before you start coding.
  - If you need to work on exercises outside of these hours, or in days between classes, you can ask questions on the class chat. Teachers are not on duty during these times, but might help you if they're not too busy, as will your classmates if you spend time to help them too.

## Typical weekend overview

- **9:00 AM - 6:00 PM:** Weekend Challenge. You will make an entire product based on learnings from the week. No lecture, just following step-by-step instructions to the end. 
  - Trying before you look at answers given by the steps gives you a better understanding! 
  - You can put your own twist on the products to customize and make them unique.
