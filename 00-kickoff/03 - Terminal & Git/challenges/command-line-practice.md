# Practice Command Lines

We'll first work on the command lines you've just learnt.

NOTE: **You're not allowed to use Finder (or your file browser)!**
But if you're stuck, here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/lewagon/china-product/blob/master/00-kickoff/exercises/gitcheat.md)

## tmp directory

First step, we'll create all our files in a directory named `tmp`, or *temporary* directory.

* Go to your home directory (`~`)
* Create a directory `tmp` in this home directory
* Go to the `tmp` directory.

## README file

* Inside `tmp` directory, create a file named `README`
* Open this `tmp` directory in Sublime Text. Write some text in the `README` file.

## Level-1 directory

* Create a `level-1` directory in the `tmp` directory
* Go to this directory and create a file named `README-level1`
* Display the path where you are

## Level-2 directory

* Go back to the parent directory
* From `tmp` directory, create a directory named `level-2` inside the directory `level-1`
* Still from 'tmp' directory, create a file named `configuration` inside the directory `level-2` (which is inside `level-1`)

## Playing with files

Let's use the `mv` command that you'll use to move/rename folders and files.
It's time to act like a real developer! Use google to find out how to complete the following instructions:

* Move this configuration file from `level-2` directory to `level-1` directory
* Go to `level-1` directory
* Rename `configuration` file into `config`
* List all files
* Remove `level-2` directory
* Remove `config` file

### Final words

* Go back to your home (`~`) directory
* **Do not** destroy the `tmp` directory - we'll be using it in the next exercise
* Clear the terminal window: use the [guide](https://github.com/lewagon/china-product/blob/master/00-kickoff/exercises/gitcheat.md) if you need to
