## Practicing Command Line

We’ll first work on the command lines you’ve just learnt. 

NOTE: **You’re not allowed to use Finder (or your file browser)!**
But if you're stuck, here a [cheatsheet](gitcheat.md)

### `temp` folder

First step, we’ll create all our files in a folder named `temp`.

- Go to your home folder (`~`)
- Create a folder `temp` in this home folder
- Go to the `temp` folder.

### README file

- Inside `temp` folder, create a file named `README`
- Open this `temp` folder in Sublime Text. Write some text in the `README` file.

### Level-1 folder

- Create a `level-1` folder in the `temp` folder.
- Go to this folder and create a file named `README-level1`
- Display the path where you are

### Level-2 folder

- Go back to the parent folder
- From `temp` folder, create a folder named `level-2` inside the folder `level-1`
- Still from ‘temp’ folder, create a file named `configuration` inside the folder `level-2` (which is inside `level-1`)

### Playing with files

Let’s use the `mv` command that you’ll use to move/rename folders and files.
It’s time to act like a real developer! Use this [guide](terminalcheat.md)

- Move this configuration file from `level-2` folder to `level-1` folder
- Go to `level-1` folder
- Rename `configuration` file into `config`
- List all files
- Remove `level-2` folder
- Remove `config` file

### Final words

- Go back to your home (`~`) folder
- **DO NOT** Destroy the temp folder - we'll use it next exercise
- Clear the terminal window: use the [guide](terminalcheat.md) if you need

When you’re done you can look at the links below.
