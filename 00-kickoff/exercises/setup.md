## Log on [github.com](http://github.com) 

Give us your **github name** so you can be added to [repo](www.github.com/dounan1/china-product) for exercises. Your name is the part after `/` e.g. `dounan1` for `www.github.com/dounan1`



## Setup

Let's set up your workstation:

1. **10:15am**: Go through a 15 min first lecture with your teacher about the tools you need to install as a developer.
2. **10:30am-12pm**: Follow [Le Wagon's setup carefully](https://github.com/lewagon/setup) and ask for help whenever you are stuck. It should take you all morning, and might overlap a bit into your lunch break for non-Mac users ðŸ˜‰.
3. **1pm-1:15pm**: Second 15 min lecture on command line basics (navigating through the filesystem, creating directories & files, launching Sublime Text from terminal, etc.)
4. **1:15pm-2pm**: Third 45 min lecture on git commands (`git add`/`git commit`/`git push`).
5. **2pm-2:15pm**: At the end of the git lecture, your teacher will show you the learning platform (lectures, exercises, challenges) 
6. **2:15pm-4pm**: Time to push your attempt to the first challenge of the bootcamp. This challenge is just a safety check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. 
7. **4pm - ready**: Time to prepare a pitch of your idea for project week. We'll give you guidance, but you'll have to do your best to win over your classmates into voting for you!
8. Project Idea pitch and vote! 

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new best friends on your computer are:

- **Sublime Text**, the text editor you will use write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands.
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!

## WeChat Mini Program Account
