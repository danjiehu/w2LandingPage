Let's set up your workstation:

1. **10:00am - 10:15am**: Go through a 15 min first lecture with your teacher about the tools you need to install as a developer.
2. **10:30am - 12:00pm**: Follow our setup guide and ask for help whenever you are stuck. It should take you all morning, and might overlap a bit into your lunch break for non-Mac users ðŸ˜‰.
3. **1:00pm - 1:15pm**: Second 15 min lecture on command line basics (navigating through the filesystem, creating directories & files, launching Sublime Text from terminal, etc.)
4. **1:15pm - 2:00pm**: Third 45 min lecture on git commands (`git add`/`git commit`/`git push`).
5. **2:00pm - 2:15pm**: At the end of the git lecture, your teacher will show you the learning platform (lectures, exercises, challenges) 
6. **2:15pm - 4:00pm**: Time to push your attempt to the first challenge of the bootcamp. This challenge is just a safety check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo. 
7. **4:00pm - finish**: Project pitch and votes! 

You now have all the tools you need to successfully work your way through the bootcamp during these 9 weeks. Remember, your new best friends on your computer are:

- **Sublime Text**, the text editor you will use write Ruby code (and more!)
- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands.
- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!
