## Commit to Git

## Letâ€™s talk about commitment! (with Git).

In the â€˜tempâ€™ folder from your previous exercise. Let's make it permanent on the web!

Create a git repo with the folder:

`git init`

Commit the files with Git! Remember the three steps:

1. status
2. add
3. commit

Tip: Use a simple but precise commit message to describe your work! You should always be able to tell what work was done by the messages alone.

Finally, create a new repo on Github.

Let's install the `hub` to create a Github repo from your terminal without opening your browser (very useful when you are lazy ðŸ˜‰)

You can find and install from its [repo](https://github.com/github/hub/releases)

Now you can **init**(ialize) a git repository, commit your changes, and create the associated Github repo:

```bash
hub create # this creates the associated repo on Github!
```

To open the Github repo from your browser you can run:

```bash
hub browse
```

After you've created the repo, you can push up the code with git! Then refresh the github page to see if the files are there!
