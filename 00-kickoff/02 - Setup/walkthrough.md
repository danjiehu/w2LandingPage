# Setup Instructions

Let's set up your workstation!

## Schedule for Today

1. **10:00 AM - 10:15 AM**: Go through a 15 min first lecture with your teacher about the tools you need to install as a developer

2. **10:30 AM - 12:00 PM**: Follow our setup guide and ask for help whenever you are stuck. It should take you all morning, and might overlap a bit into your lunch break for non-Mac users ðŸ˜‰

3. **1:00 PM - 1:15 PM**: Second 15 min lecture on command line basics (navigating through the filesystem, creating directories & files, launching Sublime Text from terminal, etc.)

4. **1:15 PM - 2:00 PM**: Third 45 min lecture on git commands (`git add`/`git commit`/`git push`).

5. **2:00 PM - 2:15 PM**: At the end of the git lecture, your teacher will show you the learning platform (lectures, exercises, challenges)

6. **2:15 PM - 4:00 PM**: Time to push your attempt to the first exercises of the bootcamp. This exercise is just a safety check to ensure you have correctly forked the exercise repo.

7. **4:00 PM - Finish**: Project Introductions

---

Today, we'll make sure that we have setup the following tools:

- **Sublime Text**, the text editor you will use write Ruby code (and more!)

- The **Terminal**, also called a shell, where you'll type commands.

- **git**, the version control tool you'll use to watch your code, snapshot, and thus submit your attempts to Kitt!

Glad you are here! Let's rock it ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!
