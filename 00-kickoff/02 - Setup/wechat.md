To setup your WeChat Developer account that you'll use for developing WeChat Mini Programs for the camp, follow this [guide](https://medium.com/@yelin.qiu/a-complete-manual-on-wechat-mini-program-development-8fd28a85ee0d) on these steps:

Keep in mind you have to register a new account for each app that you want released to the WeChat app store (e.g. your project app). For developing camp apps, we can reuse the same account.
