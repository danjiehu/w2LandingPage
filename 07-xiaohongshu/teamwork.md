## Collaboration

**Every day planning is key!** Build from the inside out: 
First **must-have** core stories and then **good-to-have** additions.

A good plan is flexible, letting stories change without depending on any one story for the product to be complete (except the few core stories that are to be done before others).

Everybody talks and everyone takes ownership, the manager just makes sure all responsibilities are covered and assigned, to be done within the time available.

**Daily sprints: the key to velocity is planning, communication, and working across roles**

Start the day with a **standup** that focuses on **one key deliverable** for the day. Pick a must-have core story if available. Everyone works together to make sure it's delivered and deployed by the end of the day.

Example:

```
- PM: goal for today is letting users see cards

- Design: I'll start designing this page with hard-coded fake data.

- Frontend: Wait, let's all decide on the data from a mockup first. 
I can work on receiving and sending data for the page. 
We'll start right after standup and take just 10 minutes. 

- Backend: Ok my goal today is to set up the BaaS table that provides this data. 

- Frontend: Perfect, I'll hard-code this data from our mockup.
 It'll act like it's coming from the backend to serve the page views. 
Designer can give the finished view later. This way no one is blocked or waiting. 
If we all meet our goal precisely, all pieces will come together.

- PM: I will follow up with you guys to make sure you have the mockup in 10 minutes. 
As you are working, I will review the design, the frontend, and backend tables. 

I'll make sure we're all on the right track today and everyone has work to do. 
No surprises at the end of the day. We'll deploy exactly what we planned on-time. 
Then we can all go home. 

- PM: Standup is done, go team!
```

## Mockups

Try an [Online Tool](https://wireframe.cc/AWGmuu) or just on paper! There's also [Modao](https://modao.cc/) and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com).

Think napkin drawings. Do a page in just a few minutes! Not for designing (for Figma and other tools!)  just getting an idea down.

## User stories

```
As a <ROLE>
I can <ACTION>
So that <VALUE>
```

e.g.

```
As a customer
I can see all the cards
So that I can learn and interact with them
```

Stories go from left to right (TODO > In Progress > Done) as they're being completed.

> Note the *development stories* the tasks people mentioned in the standup! They can be added as well and tracked.

You can now work **anywhere**, **anytime**, with people who all **know what to do** and **where to find info**. 

This is the modern method of collaboration that's a vital part of the digital economy!

## Happy Collaborating!
