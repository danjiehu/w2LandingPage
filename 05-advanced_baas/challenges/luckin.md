Meteoric Rise? The Starbucks Killer? Either way - it's **Social eCommerce** at its best!



## The Business

Luckin Coffee, founded in 2017, in less than **two years**, has become the **second-largest** café chain in China, with 3,300 outlets—after Starbucks, which has nearly 4,000 stores.

It’s now gunning for the number one spot, pushing aggressively with offers like delivering coffee in under 30 minutes, deep-discounting and an **order-online-pick-up-at-store** service.
