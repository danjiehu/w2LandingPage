## Background and Objectives

You will create a **many-to-many** data model for your Dianping mini-program by means of creating a **join** table.

## Specs

### Create Tables

Today, we will implement 3 tables in our Dianping mini-program:
  1. `restaurants`
  2. `_userprofile` 
  3. `reviews`

Which table stores a record for each of the combinations of the other two tables? ðŸ¤”

#### 1. Create a `restaurants` table 

Remember: Only logged in users can create restaurants

It should have at least the following columns:
- `name` as a `string`
- `description` as a `string`
- `photo` , what type should it be?
> `description` and `photo` are **not** required fields

#### 2. `_userprofile` table is auto-generated by the BaaS

With the BaaS SDK, users' data will be stored in this table! 
- Try adding a `photo` column
> User photo is **not** a required field

#### 3. Create a `reviews` table in the same way

Again, only users who have logged in can write reviews, same as restaurants
 
It should have the required fields:
- `content` as a `string`
- `rating` as an `integer`

More importantly, because 1) each restaurant can have multiple reviews posted by different users and 2) each user can post multiple reviews on different restaurants, reviews will have its own (**join**) table. So you will need to add two `foreign keys`

Before you start adding data, let's learn how users can sign up, log in and log out!
