## Background & Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to practice implementing the READ feature of CRUD with the SDK, where:
- As a user, I can view comments for one story

## Specs 
- Use a filter to find comments for just one story like we did in the weekend Toutiao challenge!
- What is the **query** for comparing story_id?

```js
 query.compare('story_id', '=', id)
```
