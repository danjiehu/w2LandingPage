#### Today's setup will be slightly different!

You will continue to work and build on your **Dianping mini-program** from Thursday.

<hr>

### Morning (Challenge)

You will spend the **morning**:
- Completing your sign-up, login and logout system (if you haven't already)
- Implementing the READ feature of CRUD to your Dianping, where:
  - As a public user, I can view all restaurants
  - As a public user, I can view one restaurant
  - As a public user, I can view a restaurant's reviews

ðŸŽ¯ You will need to **complete** the user journey above ðŸ‘† before the **afternoon lecture**. If you're falling behind schedule, you can always ask your buddy or teacher for help!

<hr>

### Afternoon (Lecture & Exercises)

The afternoon lecture will start at **1:00 PM** sharp! Don't be late. 

- You will learn to implement more **advanced** user actions:
  - As a logged-in user, I can post reviews and ratings
  - As a logged-in user, I can place an order

ðŸŽ¯ There will also be **exercises** for you to complete - similar to Tuesday and Thursday's setup!
