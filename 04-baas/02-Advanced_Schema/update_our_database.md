## Background and Objectives

You will create a **many-to-many** data model for your Dianping mini-program by means of creating a **join** table.

## Specs

### Update Tables

We should have three tables in our BaaS already:
  1. `restaurants`
  2. `_userprofile` 
  3. `reviews`

Which table stores a record for each of the combinations of the other two tables? ðŸ¤”

#### 2. `_userprofile` table is auto-generated by the BaaS

With the BaaS SDK, users' data will be stored in this table! 
- Try adding a `photo` column
> User photo is **not** a required field

#### 3. Update the `reviews` table

Again, only users who have logged in can write reviews.
 
It should have the required fields:
- `content` as a `string`
- `rating` as an `integer`

More importantly, because 1) each restaurant can have multiple reviews posted by different users and 2) each user can post multiple reviews on different restaurants, reviews is also the **joint** table. So you will need to add two `foreign keys` (in Minapp they are called `pointers`) to it.
